 hsfsys1 - updated version of 1st release of program that conducts OCR
           on a binary image of an HSF form.
 hsfsys2 - 2nd release of program that conducts OCR on a binary image
           of an HSF form.
 mis2evt - produces the eigenvectors from the covariance matrix of 32x32
           or 128X128 binary characters stored in an MIS file.
 mis2pat1 - computes KL feature vectors from 32x32 or 128x128 binary
            images stored in an MIS file and writes out a patterns-tree
            file and a median vector file. These files are used by the
            program "hsfsys1".
 mis2pat2 - computes KL feature vectors from 32x32 or 128x128 binary
           images stored in an MIS file and writes out a patterns file.
           This file is used by the programs "hsfsys2" and "mlp".
 mlp - Main routine for running the Multi-Layer Perceptron training
       and testing program.
 trainreg - program for training generalized form registration on new
            form type. The output of this program is used in "hsfsys2".
